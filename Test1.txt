Bayern Munich honorary president Uli Hoeness says the club are competing with Liverpool to appoint Xabi Alonso as manager.

Spaniard Alonso, a former player of both clubs, is on the brink of guiding Bayer Leverkusen to their first German Bundesliga title.

Bayern and Liverpool are both looking to appoint new managers this summer.

"Clubs like Liverpool, Real Madrid, Leverkusen and FC Bayern are working on it," Hoeness told Ran Sport.

"He's proven that he can be a coach for the big time. There are hardly any coaches who come into question who are currently free, who don't have a job or who are on sabbatical.

"It's not so easy to tell them that FC Bayern is the measure of all things."
